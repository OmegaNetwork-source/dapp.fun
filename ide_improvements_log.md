# IDE Improvements: Resizable Console & File Deletion

We have enhanced the DApp Forge IDE with two new user-requested features:

## 1. Resizable Console
- The bottom console panel is now **resizable**.
- Hover over the border between the code editor and the console until the cursor changes to a resize arrow.
- **Drag Up/Down** to adjust the console height, allowing you to see more logs during deployment.

## 2. File Deletion
- A **Delete (Trash)** icon now appears next to each file in the file explorer when you hover or look at the list.
- Click the trash icon to delete a file.
- Requires confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.
- Automatically handles closing tabs and focusing appropriately after deletion.

These changes make the development workflow smoother and more flexible!
